I have watched hundreds of hours of keynotes related to Cloud Computing and DevOps in general, but here's a list of some of the keynotes I love.


## A Day in the Life of a Netflix Engineer (Series by Dave Hahn)

These talks are by far my favorite keynotes. They are a major reason why I love DevOps. The talks provide an insightful behind-the-scenes look at how Netflix operates entirely in the Cloud. I must have watched these videos hundreds of times by now, and I still learn something new every time I watch them.
