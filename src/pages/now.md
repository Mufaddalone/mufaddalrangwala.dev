I am a graduate student at Santa Clara University, studying Computer Science. My current coursework includes Operating Systems and Software Engineering.

Actively seeking internships for Summer 2024, my focus is on general Software Engineering roles with a particular interest in DevOps and Backend Development.

### What I claim to know

These are the Technologies/Tools I am proficient in, just some things off the top of my head that I have used in either my personal projects or during my internship:

- Python 
- Swift
  - SwiftUI
  - UIKit
- Golang
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
  - API Gateway
  - DynamoDB
  - Lambda
  - S3
  - RDS
  - EC2
  - Fargate
- Micorosft Azure
  - Function Apps
  - PowerShell
  - Blob Storage
  - CosmosDB
  - Azure DevOps
- Jenkins

### What I want to know

For the past 2.5 to 3 years, I have always liked DevOps. I was lucky that during my final year, I got to work for 11 months as an SRE (Site Reliability Engineer), which is essentially a DevOps engineer. I like DevOps because when programming, I enjoy listening to keynotes. I have watched hundreds of hours of AWS Reinvent, Oracle OpenWorld, and Google Cloud Connect keynotes. As a result, I know a lot about how and when some of these tools are used, but I would also love to work with them in real life myself. 

So here's the list; it's not really exhaustive. If you ask me tomorrow, I might add some things.

- Kubernetes (K8s)
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Advanced CI/CD Pipelines
- Cloud Security  
- Reinforcement Learning
- Chaos Engineering 

### What I want to be

If you don't count internships as work experience, then right now I have none, lol. A lot of times in interviews, when asked what my career goals are, I describe my love for programming. For me, even Leetcode is fun to some extent, though it does get a bit much when you're studying for interviews like I am ðŸ™ƒ.

Anyway, ideally, I would live in the Bay Area, and this is what I envision for my career trajectory. Fingers crossed XDD.
